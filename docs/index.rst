PFD-kit version |version| documentation
----------------------------------------

PFD-kit is a cloud-based workflow written in Python, delicately designed to generate a deep learning based model of interatomic potential energy and force field. PFD-kit is based on pre-trained (P) Large Atomic Models through fine-tune (F) and distillation (D). Compared to concurrent learning method, e.g. DP-GEN, the PFD-kit requires less computational resources and time, eliminates the need for supervision by materials science experts while producing models with stronger generalization capabilities. This makes it highly effective for supporting high-throughput calculations and addressing challenges in training models for complex material systems, such as high-entropy alloys and surfaces/interfaces.
The main features of PFD-kit include automated data generation, model training, evaluation and maintain job queues on HPC machines (High Performance Cluster), making it a powerful tool for researchers in the field
of computational materials science.
